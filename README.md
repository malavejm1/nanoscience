Hello! In this repo are a handful of simulation engineering and data analysis codes I designed to aid my research efforts. The codes here are ones that I designed from top-to-bottom. Codes I co-constructred for the group are a part of a private repo maintained by Dr. Kalman Varga and Dr. Cody Covington. As I cannot freely share these codes, I am open to presenting its contents upon request without formal invitation to join the repo. Note the lack of generality these codes may possess: most are narrow in purpose to meet the needs of research but are easily generalizeable.

Thanks!
