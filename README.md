Hello! In this repo are simulation engineering and data analysis codes I designed to assist with my research efforts. The codes here are ones that I designed from top-to-bottom. Codes I co-constructred for the group are a part of a private repo maintained by Dr. Kalman Varga and Dr. Cody Covington. As I cannot freely share these codes, I am open to presenting its contents upon request without formal invitation to join the repo. Note the lack of generality the codes in this repo possess: most are narrow in purpose, as they were made to meet the demands of technical research steps. However, they are easily generalizeable.

In addition to these programs are codes I designed for recreational purposes -- such as simple neural
networking codes and a humorous exercise involving a Twitter bot.

I've also provided my publications and most recent presentation in the "Publications" folder, as all of this media lay behind paywalls.

Thanks!
