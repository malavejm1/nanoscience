Code that uses the time-dependent variational principle to 
optimizes the parameters of Neon electron wave functions, confined
in a photonic cavity, of the variational Monte Carlo form.

The methods use here may be read about on pages 119 and 250 of
"Computational Nanoscience", by Kalman Varga and
Joseph Driscoll.

The codes are adapated from the source code on the book's
